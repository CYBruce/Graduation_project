description:

Research on Network Control Algorithm Based on Reinforcement Learning:  
Boundary control methods such as signal control, line restriction, and congestion charging are effective to ensure smooth traffic in cities. Dynamic modeling of road network based on the basic graph, using approximate dynamic programming (adptive/approximate dynamic programming), or reinforcement learning approximation, to compute the cotrol rate of urban network system and make corresponding control strategy .

"基于adp/强化学习的网络控制算法研究":  
边界控制如信号控制、限行、拥堵收费等是保障城市交通顺畅的有效手段。基于宏观基本图对路网动态建模，用近似动态规划(adptive/approximate dynamic programming)、或强化学习逼近，高效求解城市网络系统（用宏观基本图建模）的控制率，设计相应的控制策略。
